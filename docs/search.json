    "text": "This is the first post. Welcome!\n\nNice to meet you! My name is Simone Brazzi. I am 33 years old guy from Bologna, Italy.\nI decided to open this blog as a personal journal (what a new idea! Who ever thought about this?) of my data journey. This also means it is an opportunity to display my portfolio and shares my projects.\nAt the date of writing, I am a self made data professional. I am currently working as a Data Analyst/Engineer for UniCredit Group.\nI have too many hobbies, but I will try to summarize them in a sparse order:\n\nTraining: my 2024 goal is to be able to run at least an half marathon.\nStudy: I am studying data science to further improve my knowledge in the data field. I would like to do a Master Degree in the field, but it is difficult to combine the private life with an international MSc, at least for now.\nGaming, movies and manga: of course! I mean, it is part of being a nerd, right?! For cliche purpose, I love Quentin Tarantino blabbering, Nolan craziness, even though my favorite genre is horror. My favorites directors are Jordan Pelee and Ari Aster. I am currently reading Berserker, My Hero Academia, Jujutsu Kaisen, One Piece, Chainsaw Man and Kagurabachi.\nCooking, I think it is in my vein being italian (joking!) and considering my mother is a chef.\n\nFor now, I think I have annoyed you enough: stay tuned for future posts!"

    "text": "I am a (data) nerd, with lot of passion and some mistake along the way. Data analyst by day, aspiring data wizard by night! I love using data to tell stories and drive business decisions. But I’m not content with stopping there. My passion for data and desire to expand my skillset has led me on a quest to become a data scientist. I’m a fearless problem solver with an insatiable curiosity, and I’m always seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Let’s make some magic with data! When I don’t stare tolines of code or spreadsheet, I like to read and play video game or spend quality time with my dog."
